# NSP Bootcamp 2022

### This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, toy data, and other materials for the 2022 University of Colorado Neuroscience Graduate Program incoming 1st year quantitative methods and coding bootcamp. This repo for the python days of the bootcamp, Thursday and Friday August 25-26. 

#### The bootcamp is instructor-led, with lectures and guided and independent coding, with TAs available. 

### Morning session, 9:30 - ~11:30AM
The first part of the session are  formatted to be interactive lectures; after the introductory slides, we will be running code together, with students running and writing code along with the instructors. 
<br>
The latter part of each session will be held as a looser group session. The instructor will lay out the goals with the whole group at 2PM. After that, it will be independent and small group work for the duration. We encourage you to ask lots of questions during this time. We hope to have more in-depth questions, discussions, and check-in throughout the time.
