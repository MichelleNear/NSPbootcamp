The afternoon sessions will be held as a looser group session. The instructor will lay out the goals with the whole group at 2PM. After that, it will be independent and small group work for the duration. We encourage you to ask questions in the Slack channel during this time; we will use the main Zoom call to spawn breakout rooms for more in-depth questions, discussions, and check-ins.
