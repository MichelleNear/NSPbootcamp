The afternoon sessions will be held as a looser group session. The instructor will lay out the goals with the whole group at 2PM. After that, it will be independent and small group work for the duration. We encourage you to ask lots of questions during this time. We hope to have more in-depth questions, discussions, and check-in throughout the time.
