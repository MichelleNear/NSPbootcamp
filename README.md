#### The bootcamp is instructor-led, with lectures and guided coding in the AM and independent coding with TAs available in the PM. 

### Morning session, 9:30 - 11:30AM
The morning session are  formatted to be interactive lectures; after the introductory slides, we will be running code together, with students running and writing code along with the instructors. A second screen would be useful, but it is not required.

### Afternoon session, 2:00 - 4:00PM+
The afternoon sessions will be held as a looser group session, running in parallel on Slack and Zoom. The instructor will lay out the goals with the whole group on Zoom at 2PM. After that, it will be independent and small group work for the duration. We encourage you to ask lots of questions in the Slack channel during this time; we will use the main Zoom call to spawn breakout rooms for more in-depth questions, discussions, and check-ins.
